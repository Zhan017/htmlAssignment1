  <h3>5. <em>FIFA 2021</em></h3>
  <img src="https://coremission.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/78065517-90F8-4795-9170-21355C436928-800x557.jpeg" alt="FIFA 2021">
  <p><strong>FIFA 21</strong> is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series.
    It is the 28th installment in the FIFA series, and was <strong>released 9 October 2020</strong> for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
    Enhanced versions for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S were released on 3 December <strong>2020</strong> and this version was the best of the FIFA series in 2020.
  </p>
  <h3>4. <em> Call of Duty : Warzone</em></h3>
  <img src="https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/geforce/news/call-of-duty-warzone-out-now-pc-system-requirements/call-of-duty-warzone-screenshot-001-850px.jpg" alt="Call of Duty : Warzone">
  <p><strong>Call of Duty : Warzone</strong> took a 4th place. A free add-on to 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Warzone is a <em>Fortnite-style</em> battle royale shooter, with just enough
    original ideas to feel fresh. Most Fortnite clones have come up short, but Warzone’s systems, strategies and progressions provided dozens and
    dozens of hours of distraction as we adjusted to spending more time at home during lockdown.
  </p>
  <h3>3. <em> Cyberpunk 2077</em></h3>
  <img src="https://i.playground.ru/p/gn5U5lI0xYCmbdCWYkbBIg.jpeg?800-auto" alt="Cyberpunk 2077">
  <p><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong> is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. Gamers waited this game for 10 years. Top game with amizing gameplay, but still it has a lot of bugs to fix.
    The story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe.Players assume the first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and
    machinery with options for melee and ranged combat.
  </p>
  <h3>2. <em>Last of Us Part II</em></h3>
  <img src="https://ixbt.online/live/images/original/16/47/07/2020/06/23/9abbbcb26d.jpg?w=877" alt="Last of Us 2">
  <p><strong>Last of Us II</strong> has been developed for 6 years and realeased in June 2020. The post-apocalyptic game takes a lot of big swings that will surprise, frustrate and even enrage many players—
    but they are thought-provoking risks. <br> At the 38th Golden Joystick Awards in November 2020, the game won all six awards for which it was nominated: Ultimate Game of the Year, Best Audio, Best Storytelling,
    Best Visual Design, PlayStation Game of the Year, and Studio of the Year for Naughty Dog.
  </p>
  <h2>1. <em> Among Us</em></h2>
  <img src="https://www.teknofilo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Among-us-1.jpg" alt="Among Us">
  <p>Finally, here is <i>the most popular game</i> in 2020, <strong>Among Us</strong> is an incredibly simple game, yet no two rounds are the same. The popularity of this game has grown by a thousand times <em>during the quarantine</em>.
    Up to 10 players all head into space, where a band of beans serving as crewmates on a station or ship have to work together to complete a variety of tiny tasks. The problem is that one to three of those crewmates are hidden impostors,
    who have the ability to sabotage the station and murder their comrades. When a player discovers a body or hits an emergency meeting button, everyone gathers together to try and uncover the truth, and it inevitably goes wrong.
